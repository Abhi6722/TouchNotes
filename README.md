## Problem Statement :
If you are a student then Notes is something which cannot ignore or we can say without it we can't do anything. We jot down notes daily and you know what is the real problem that we face? It is finding the notes at time of need and if you have a habbit of forgetting things like I do then you must be facing a lots of issues my friend. Keeping all these in mind I came up with an idea of creating a Notes App that can possibly solve my problems.

## Proposed Solution :
- **Touch Notes** is a note taking application build using Kotlin. The main problem that I was facing was finding the notes that I took so in order to solve this problem I make my notes digital which will be with me always. And a search bar is added at the top of screen so that notes can be easily found and this solved my very first problem. 
- Well there are various note taking application available out there but the thing that distinguish Touch Notes from other note taking app is it's light weight and beautiful UI. The application is light weight (4.61 MB) which can run on almost all android devices (greater or equal to android v5.0). 
- While writing notes it is not just text that we write. So this app contains option to add images and links which makes the notes more interactive.
- We often divide our notes in categories or subjects which make it more accessible so this app contains option to add different colours to the note.
- A good note is that which is updated and revised regularly so this app contains the option to Re-edit the notes. 

## Features :

- **Plain Text Notes** - Take notes in an Secure & Great App.
- **Delete Notes** - Delete Notes using One Touch.
- **Web Url** - Add Website URL for storing Url.
- **Add Image** - Add Images in Notes to keep it Awesome.
- **Notes Colours** - Change/Add Different colours of Notes.
- **Re-edit Notes** - Re-edit or Update Your Notes.
